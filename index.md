# this is inside an h1, apparently
## this, an h2
### h threeeeee

I feel the instructions were a little vauge with "On the Edit file tab, add a #, followed by a space, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six # characters followed by a space." There's no content, here.
Also, from a personal comma-use style, I also think it should have been written "followed by a space, before any content you like, to make it an H1 Header".
